My preferred strategy is for you to shape the issue by saying, “Here is what we’re pushing for. Here are the alternatives we’ve considered. We’d like to get your input.” Now if you did your pre-meeting job you already know people’s views. I would start the conversation by asking somebody to weigh in. It’s not your job to debate every board member. If somebody takes an aggressive tone against your desired outcome you can rebut it or you can call on somebody on the board who shares your opinion and ask them to weigh in. Over time you’ll figure out who the most persuasive board members are and who backs down too easily. Control the discussion. Make sure people feel heard. And if you think you have the votes then it’s time to say, “Ok, I think we’ve heard everybody’s opinion on this topic. If it’s ok with you, I’d like to propose we put this to a vote. All those in favor of the budget we’ve outlined … (or all those in favor of the budget we’ve outlined with amendments to the cost-line offered by Bob).” The reason I point this out is that all too often decisions go round and round and run out the clock with no sense of moving towards a decision.
